## Unsupervised Quantification of Animal Behavior

This repository is a collection of different work-in-progress approaches in unsupervised machine learning for the quantification of animal behavior. 

The main analysis pipeline does or will soon contain:

- pose estimation from video (see DeepLabCut)
- multi-view triangulation and 3D reconstruction (see Anipose)
- UMAP dimensionality reduction
- time series analysis with VAME, TICC, HMM
